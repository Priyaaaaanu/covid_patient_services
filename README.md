# covid_patient_services


The project “COVID PATIENT SERVICES” mainly aims at rendering the best possible services to patients, tested positive for COVID-19. Patients can avail various services depending on the extent of severity, i.e. mild or severe. If the symptoms are mild , patients are recommended of home isolation wherein, if necessary, services from the hospital are provided whereas if there is a serious illness , patients are advised to admit to the hospital. If a patient gets admitted to the hospital, the receptionist manages the task of allocating doctors to treat the patient as well as the duties such as allocation of ward. The treatment for the patient then begins.

CONCLUSION

After we completed the project we are sure that the problems in the existing world would be solved. The project “COVID PATIENT SERVICES” is for computerizing the working and services. 
The software takes care of all requirements and is capable to provide easy and effective storage of information related to patients. It provides patient details, doctor details, prescription given to a particular patient, ward details and its price and more. 


FUTURE SCOPE

All the work done manually by the receptionist and other operational staff and lots of papers are needed to be handled and this situation will be cared. Utmost care has been taken to make the system efficient and user friendly. Finally we would get all the information of a particular patient, about his treatment so that the data would be accessible for further usage.

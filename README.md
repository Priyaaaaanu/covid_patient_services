#overview
The project “COVID PATIENT SERVICES” mainly aims at rendering the best possible services to patients, tested positive for COVID-19. Patients can avail various services depending on the extent of severity, i.e. mild or severe. If the symptoms are mild , patients are recommended of home isolation wherein, if necessary, services from the hospital are provided whereas if there is a serious illness , patients are advised to admit to the hospital. If a patient gets admitted to the hospital, the receptionist manages the task of allocating doctors to treat the patient as well as the duties such as allocation of ward. The treatment for the patient then begins.
